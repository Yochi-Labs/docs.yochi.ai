# NFT Guardian

NFT Guardian is a feature of Yochi's threat detection system that specifically focuses on identifying and protecting Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) from malicious actors. NFTs, which are unique digital assets that cannot be replicated or replaced, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, this popularity has also led to an increase in attacks on NFTs, such as hacking and fraud.

With NFT Guardian, Yochi's system is able to constantly monitor and analyze NFT transactions on the blockchain, identifying any potential threats and alerting users in real-time. This allows users to take preventative measures and protect their valuable NFTs from being stolen or compromised. Our system also includes advanced data fusion and ETL technology, which allows us to detect threats on multiple blockchain networks, providing comprehensive protection for all types of NFTs.
