# Threat Alerts System

The threat alerts system is a key feature of Yochi's threat detection system. It allows users to receive real-time notifications of potential threats on the blockchain network through various channels such as Telegram, webhooks, Discord, and email. This ensures that users are always informed of any potential security risks and can take action to protect their assets. The alerts are highly customizable and can be tailored to the user's specific needs and preferences. Our goal is to provide users with the most comprehensive and timely threat information possible, so they can make informed decisions and stay one step ahead of potential attackers.
